    eumm-upgrade is a tool to allow using new features of
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker without losing compatibility with older versions. It
    adds compatibility code to Makefile.PL and tries to automatically detect
    some properties like license, minimum Perl version required and
    repository used.

    Just run eumm-upgrade.pl in directory with Makefile.PL. Old file will be
    copied to Makefile.PL.bak. If you use Github, Internet connection is
    required.

    You need to check resulting Makefile.PL manually as transformation is done
    with regular expressions.

    If you need to declare number of spaces in indent in Makefile.PL, use
    following string at start of it (set 'c-basic-offset' to your value):

    # -*- mode: perl; c-basic-offset: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-
